# Udacity---Data-Analyst




## Project 1 : Explore Weather Trends

### Project description

In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends. Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.


## Project 2 : Investigate a Dataset

### Project description

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

## Project 3 : Analyze A/B Test Results

### Project description

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
